# @hard-edging/core

Hard-Edging core runtime: shared types, CRDT-backed documents, and the basic wiring needed to let your users' browsers do the hard work while your servers stay suspiciously idle.

This package is intentionally designed without any CDN assumptions; all code is meant to ship from your origin and then explode into a mesh of peers.
