# @hard-edging/cli

The `hard-edging` CLI scaffolds and runs Hard-Edging applications. It wires together Vite, the broker, and your mesh so you can focus on writing components instead of hand‑stitching dev servers and signalling layers every weekend.

Use it to:

- `init` new projects with a mesh‑ready template
- `dev` to start the broker + Vite in one go
- `build` to produce production bundles
- `mesh-inspect` (future) to introspect what your peers are actually doing

In a sense, the CLI is the ritual that turns a normal app into a peer‑to‑peer organism. One command, and suddenly your local tabs are negotiating amongst themselves.
